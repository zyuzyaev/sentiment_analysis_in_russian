# sentiment_analysis_in_russian

# Overview
As is stated in the description of this repo, it was created with an aim of storing Python code for the Master's thesis regarding sentiment analysis in the Russian language.

The whole work is comprised of steps in the given order.

There are notebooks about parsing data and compiling it into a dataset, exploring the latter, and applying three distinct methods of sentiment analysis to it afterwards. As a bonus, there is a notebook about implementing the Dostoevsky library for sentiment analysis as a counterpart to the VADER approach.

Additionally, there is a file "short_dataset" which contains the data (approx. 23 000 book reviews) utilized in some of the notebooks. Since the github does not allow one to upload files more than 25 Mb in size, the original version of the dataset with over 80 000 book reviews was sent to the google drive.
